* Bug 001 :wontfix_soon:
  Indexing a 700Kb gem take too much time, it seems looping
  Avoid indexing gem file for the meantime.

  Reindexing does not work very well. Code Zauker will not automatically detect a file has changed.
  Implement a md5 checksum support for reindexing changed files fast

* Bug 003 :low:
  Avoid keys() command because it is deprecated for normal usage scenario
